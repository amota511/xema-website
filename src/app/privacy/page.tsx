              </h3>
              <p>
                If you create an account and opt into cloud synchronization,
                your data is synced to Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase
                Storage. Cloud sync enables:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Access to your data across multiple devices</li>
                <li>Automatic backup to prevent data loss</li>
                <li>Continuity when switching or upgrading devices</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You can enable or disable cloud synchronization at any time
                through the App settings. If you disable cloud sync, your data
                will remain on your device but will no longer be backed up or
                synced to the cloud.

              </h3>
              <p>
                We implement appropriate technical and organizational security
                measures to protect your personal information against
                unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Data stored on your
                  device is encrypted using platform-level encryption (iOS
                  Keychain, Android Keystore). Data stored in Firebase is
                  encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted
                  between the App and our servers uses TLS/SSL encryption to
                  prevent interception.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> We use Apple Sign In
                  and Firebase Authentication, which employ industry-standard
                  security protocols including OAuth 2.0.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Access Controls:</strong> Strict access controls limit
                  who can access user data within our systems. Access is granted
                  on a need-to-know basis and is logged for audit purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Firebase Security Rules:</strong> We implement strict
                  Firebase Security Rules to ensure users can only access their
                  own data and cannot access other users&apos; information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We regularly review
                  and update our security practices to address emerging threats
                  and vulnerabilities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                While we strive to protect your personal information, no method
                of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100%
                secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security but are committed
                to protecting your information using industry best practices.

              <p>
                When you use cloud synchronization, your data is stored on
                Firebase servers, which are part of Google Cloud Platform
                infrastructure. Firebase may store data in multiple regions for
                redundancy and performance. Data may be processed in the United

              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product Scanning:</strong> When you scan or photograph
                  a product, the image and/or ingredient text is sent to OpenAI
                  API for analysis. The AI identifies potential irritants,
                  allergens, and problematic ingredients commonly associated
                  with eczema triggers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Food Photo Analysis:</strong> Food photos are analyzed
                  by AI to identify ingredients, potential allergens, and common
                  eczema trigger foods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Skin Photo Analysis:</strong> Skin photos are
                  processed by AI vision models to assess eczema severity,
                  identify affected areas, and track changes over time. This
                  helps you visualize your progress and identify patterns.

              <ul>

                  minimal context needed for analysis (e.g., &quot;analyze this

                </li>
                <li>

                  used to train or improve their models unless explicitly opted

                  only used to provide you with immediate analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Temporary Processing:</strong> AI providers process
                  your data to generate results but do not retain it long-term.
                </li>
                <li>

              </p>
              <p>
                If you believe we might have information from or about a child

            <Section title="14. Do Not Track Signals">
              <p>
                Some web browsers and mobile devices have a &quot;Do Not
                Track&quot; (DNT) feature that lets you tell websites and apps
                that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, there is no universally accepted standard for how to
                respond to DNT signals in mobile applications. As such, the App
                does not respond to DNT signals or similar mechanisms at this
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, you can control data collection through the App in the
                following ways:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Disable cloud synchronization to keep data only on your device
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disable location services to prevent collection of location
                  data
                </li>
                <li>Choose not to use AI analysis features</li>
                <li>
                  Use an anonymous/guest account instead of signing in with
                  Apple Sign In
                </li>
                <li>
                  Control camera and photo access through device settings
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If a standard for responding to DNT signals is established in
                the future that applies to mobile applications, we will assess
                our practices and update this Privacy Policy accordingly.

                  substantively change your rights, we may simply update the

                For changes that require consent under applicable law (such as
                new uses of health data or expansion of third-party sharing), we
