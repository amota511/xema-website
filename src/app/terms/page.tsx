                The App is designed as an informational and self-management
                tool only. It is NOT intended to be used for medical diagnosis,
                treatment, or professional medical advice. The App has NOT been
                evaluated, cleared, or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
                Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory health authority
                as a medical device. The App is NOT covered under the Health
                Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and should
                not be relied upon as a HIPAA-compliant service.

              <p>
                <strong>No Clinical Validation:</strong> The flare-up
                predictions, risk assessments, and probability estimates
                provided by the App are algorithmic calculations based on
                patterns in your self-reported data and are NOT clinically
                validated or guaranteed to be accurate. These predictions are
                estimates only and should not be used as the sole basis for
                medical decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Product and Food Scanning Limitations:</strong> The

                informational content only about ingredients and potential
                triggers. This information is not comprehensive, may not be
                current, and should not replace consultation with a healthcare
                provider, allergist, or dermatologist. Not all ingredients or
                allergens may be detected or flagged by the App.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>AI Analysis Limitations:</strong> The AI-powered skin
                photo analysis is a computational tool that provides automated
                observations and is NOT a substitute for professional
                dermatological examination. AI analysis may produce inaccurate,
                incomplete, or misleading results. Only a qualified healthcare
                provider can provide a proper medical evaluation of your skin
                condition.
              </p>

                <strong>Always Consult Your Healthcare Provider:</strong> You
                should ALWAYS consult with a qualified healthcare provider,

                <strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> THE APP MUST NOT BE USED
                FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SITUATIONS. If you are experiencing a

                <strong>Effect of Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel your

                AI-powered features are tools to help you track and understand
                patterns in your condition, but they are NOT a substitute for
                professional medical advice, examination, diagnosis, or

              <p>
                AI analysis of skin photos has significant limitations. Photo

                <strong>Prediction Limitations:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Flare-up predictions are statistical estimates based on
                historical patterns in your data and are not guaranteed to be
                accurate. Many factors that influence eczema flare-ups may not
                be tracked or accounted for by the App. A low predicted risk
                does not mean a flare-up will not occur, and a high predicted
                risk does not guarantee a flare-up will occur.

              </p>
              <p>
                Before filing a claim against Xema, you agree to try to resolve
                the dispute informally by contacting us at support@xema.app. We
                will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you.
                If a dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after
                submission, you or Xema may bring a formal proceeding.

                <strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute, claim,
                or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
                App (a &quot;Dispute&quot;) will be resolved by binding
                arbitration, rather than in court, except that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
                  qualify and remain in small claims court
                </li>
                <li>
                  You or Xema may seek equitable relief in court for
                  infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                enforcement of this arbitration provision. The arbitration will
                be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the
                American Arbitration Association&apos;s (AAA) Consumer
                Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified by this
                section.

                <strong>No Class Actions:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                YOU AND XEMA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
                OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR
                COLLECTIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. Unless both you and Xema
                agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one
                person&apos;s claims or otherwise preside over any form of
                representative or class proceeding.

                  The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or
                  based solely on written submissions, as you choose
                </li>
                <li>
                  The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award,
                  including attorneys&apos; fees when authorized by law
                </li>
                <li>
                  The arbitrator&apos;s decision will be final and binding, and
                  judgment on the award may be entered in any court with
                  jurisdiction
                </li>
                <li>

                <strong>Costs of Arbitration:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will
                be governed by the AAA&apos;s Consumer Arbitration Rules.

                <strong>Opt-Out of Arbitration:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within
                thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms by sending
                written notice of your decision to opt out to support@xema.app
                with the subject line &quot;ARBITRATION OPT-OUT.&quot; Your
                notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement
                that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you
                opt out, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply.
                Opting out has no effect on any previous, other, or future
                arbitration agreements you may have with us.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Either you or Xema may assert claims, if they qualify, in small
                claims court in the county where you reside or in the county
                where Xema&apos;s principal place of business is located.
                Additionally, either party may seek equitable relief in any
                court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
                threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a
                party&apos;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or
                other intellectual property rights.
              </p>

                <strong>Severability of Arbitration Provision:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be
                invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration
                provision shall be null and void, and the Dispute will be
                resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of law
                provisions below. However, the waiver of class actions and
                representative proceedings is essential, and if that waiver is
                found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this
                arbitration provision will be deemed void.

                If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid,

                jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the minimum
                extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable while
                preserving its intent. If such modification is not possible,
                the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be
                severed from these Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any

                enforceability of any other provision of these Terms, which
